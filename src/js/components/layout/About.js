            <h2>I'm Fabrice Toussaint</h2>
            <p>A twenty-something year old that has been in the development world for over 3 years. Primarily as a Front-end developer professionally and Back-end experience on personal projects. As an avid photographer and explorer, I pull inspiration from the mountains I've climbed to the valleys I've photographed to bring a unique inspiration to projects. I currently work at Complex Media with a small team of strong and reliable developers. Collectively we create new features, manage sites using legacy frameworks, dissolve bugs, and consistently brainstorming ways to always be improving the experience for our users. The sites we proudly produce and manage are 1. <a href='http://complex.com' target='_blank'>Complex.com</a> 2. <a href='http://pigeonsandplanes.com' target='_blank'>pigeonsandplanes.com</a> 3. <a href='http://solecollector.com' target='_blank'>solecollector.com</a> 4. <a href='http://firstwefeast.com' target='_blank'>firstwefeast.com</a> 5. <a href='http://collider.com' target='_blank'>collider.com</a> 6. <a href='http://theridechannel.com' target='_blank'>theridechannel.com</a></p>
            <p>I am excited to push the quality of my work further and progress with the fast pace world that is technology. Learning and building are my favorite aspects of the development world, you will always find me reading some article or tinkering around with some new technology.</p>
